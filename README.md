Nobody can disadmin or remove members without the permission of Tameem, Tawseef, or Saif. Additionally, nobody can disadmin the main admins; otherwise, punishments or penalties will be given.

Disclaimer: Saif, Tawseef, Tameem, and Rownak can decide when to give warnings and how many warnings to give before the violator starts to lose a portion of their rights. Admins can also decide when to issue penalizations, but the penalizations must follow this order:

First Violation: Warning

Next Violation (or when main admins decide to take portions of the rights): -40% rights

Next Violation (per the main admins' decision): -60% rights

Next Violation (again, per the main admins' decision): -100% rights

People can be granted a last parole (after losing 100% rights) based on the severity of the violation and fascism, and on how much rights the violator can win back through certain actions.

Losing 100% of the rights and violating last parole would result in the violator being disadmined or a punishment would be given or the violator may be removed or actions would be taken
